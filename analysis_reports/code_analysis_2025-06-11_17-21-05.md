## File: `./sample_js_files/complex.js`

**Complexity Score:** 6/10\n\n**Main Concerns:**\n- The `processData` function has nested loops and conditionals that can lead to quadratic or worse time complexity, especially with large array values.\n- The `deepNest` function exhibits cubic time complexity (O(nÂ³)), which can become very slow as `n` grows.\n- The `lotsOfBranches` function has multiple conditional branches, but overall complexity remains low (O(1)).\n\n**Improvement Suggestions:**\n- Optimize `processData` by avoiding nested loops for large numbersâ€”consider mathematical formulas or memoization.\n- Limit the depth or size parameters in `deepNest` to prevent performance issues.\n- For `lotsOfBranches`, consider using a switch statement or lookup table for clarity if branches grow further.\n- Overall, reduce nested loops and branch complexity where possible to improve maintainability and performance.

## File: `./sample_js_files/simple.js`

Complexity Score: 2/10\n\nMain Concerns:\n- The code consists of straightforward, single-purpose functions with minimal logic.\n- No control flow complexity or nested structures.\n- The only potential concern is the repetitive nature, but it doesn't impact runtime complexity.\n\nImprovement Suggestions:\n- Since functions are simple, consider grouping similar functions (e.g., all unary operations) into objects or classes for better organization.\n- Add input validation if used in critical contexts.\n- For scalability, consider generating functions dynamically if similar patterns emerge.\n\nOverall, the code is very simple and maintainable with negligible complexity.

## File: `./sample_js_files/calculator.js`

**Complexity Score:** 3/10\n\n**Main Concerns:**\n- The class is straightforward with minimal branchingâ€”mainly simple conditionals in `compute`.\n- No nested loops or recursive calls.\n- The `compute` method has some branching, but it's limited and manageable.\n\n**Improvement Suggestions:**\n- Use a switch statement in `compute` for better readability if more operations are added.\n- Add input validation for method parameters to enhance robustness.\n- Consider extending `compute` to handle more operations, which could increase complexity but should be managed carefully.\n\nOverall, the code is simple and maintainable with low complexity.
