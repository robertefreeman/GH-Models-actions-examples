## File: `./sample_js_files/complex.js`

**Complexity Score:** 6/10

**Main Concerns:**
- The `processData` function has nested loops and conditionals that can lead to quadratic or worse complexity depending on input values, especially with large odd numbers.
- The `deepNest` function exhibits cubic time complexity (O(nÂ³)), which can become very slow for large `n`.
- The `lotsOfBranches` function has multiple conditional branches, but overall minimal complexity impact.

**Improvement Suggestions:**
- Optimize nested loops in `processData` by reducing unnecessary iterations or using mathematical formulas where possible.
- Limit the depth and size of nested loops in `deepNest`, or cache intermediate results if applicable.
- Simplify branch conditions or replace with lookup tables for better readability and maintainability.
- Add input validation to prevent excessive computation for large inputs.

Overall, the code demonstrates moderate complexity primarily due to nested loops and branching, which could be optimized for performance and clarity.

## File: `./sample_js_files/simple.js`

Complexity Score: 2/10

Main Concerns:
- The code consists of straightforward, single-operation functions with minimal logic.
- No control flow, recursion, or nested structures.
- The functions are simple and easy to understand, with predictable behavior.

Improvement Suggestions:
- Since all functions are basic, consider grouping similar functions or using more generic utility functions to reduce redundancy.
- Add input validation if necessary for robustness, especially for functions like divide and mod.
- The comment mentions repeating dummy functions to reach ~200 lines; ensure that this repetition doesn't introduce unnecessary complexity or maintenance overhead.

Overall, the code is very simple with negligible complexity.

## File: `./sample_js_files/calculator.js`

**Complexity Score:** 3/10

**Main Concerns:**
- The class is straightforward with minimal branching.
- The `compute` method introduces some branching logic, but it's limited to a couple of conditions.
- No nested loops or complex data structures are present.

**Improvement Suggestions:**
- Consider using a `switch` statement in `compute` for better readability.
- Extend error handling for invalid inputs or unsupported operations.
- For scalability, implement a map of operations to functions to reduce branching.

Overall, the code is simple and maintainable with low complexity.
