## File: `./sample_js_files/complex.js`

**Complexity Score:** 6/10

**Main Concerns:**
- The `deepNest` function exhibits cubic time complexity (O(nÂ³)), which can be costly for large `n`.
- The `processData` function has nested loops, especially the inner loop for odd numbers, leading to potential quadratic or worse performance depending on input.
- The `lotsOfBranches` function has multiple conditional branches, but overall low complexity.

**Improvement Suggestions:**
- Optimize `deepNest` by reducing nested loops or using mathematical formulas to compute results directly.
- For `processData`, consider avoiding nested loops for large values or restructuring logic to minimize iterations.
- Use early returns or switch statements in `lotsOfBranches` for clarity, but its complexity impact is minimal.
- Overall, focus on reducing nested loops and branching where possible to improve performance and maintainability.

## File: `./sample_js_files/simple.js`

Complexity Score: 2/10

Main concerns:
- The code consists of straightforward, atomic arithmetic functions with no control flow or nested logic.
- The functions are simple and self-contained, leading to minimal cognitive load.
- The only potential concern is the large number of similar functions, which could be simplified or grouped for maintainability.

Improvement suggestions:
- Group related functions (e.g., basic operations, array operations) into separate modules or objects to improve organization.
- Consider using higher-order functions or utility libraries to reduce boilerplate.
- Add input validation if necessary, though for demonstration purposes, current simplicity is acceptable.

Overall, the code is very simple with negligible complexity.

## File: `./sample_js_files/calculator.js`

**Complexity Score:** 3/10

**Main concerns:**
- The class is straightforward with minimal branching.
- The `compute` method introduces some branching, but it's limited to a couple of conditions.
- No nested loops or recursive calls, keeping complexity low.
- Error handling is simple and direct.

**Improvement suggestions:**
- Use a `switch` statement in `compute` for better readability and scalability if more operations are added.
- Consider adding input validation for method arguments to enhance robustness.
- For future expansion, modularize operation handling to reduce branching.

Overall, the code is simple and maintainable with low complexity.
