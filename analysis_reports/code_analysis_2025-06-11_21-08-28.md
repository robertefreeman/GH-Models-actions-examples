## File: `./sample_js_files/complex.js`

**Complexity Score:** 6/10

**Main Concerns:**
- The `processData` function has nested loops and conditionals, leading to potentially high time complexity, especially with large array values.
- The `deepNest` function exhibits cubic time complexity (O(nÂ³)), which can become very slow as `n` increases.
- The `lotsOfBranches` function has multiple conditional branches, but overall low complexity; however, its branching adds some decision-making complexity.

**Improvement Suggestions:**
- Optimize `processData` by avoiding nested loops for large numbers, possibly using mathematical formulas.
- Limit `deepNest` depth or refactor to reduce nesting if possible.
- Use switch-case or lookup tables for `lotsOfBranches` to improve readability and maintainability.
- Add comments or documentation to clarify intent and expected input ranges to prevent misuse with large data that could cause performance issues.

## File: `./sample_js_files/simple.js`

Complexity Score: 2/10

Main Concerns:
- The code consists of straightforward, single-purpose arithmetic functions with minimal logic.
- No control flow, recursion, or nested structures present.
- The functions are simple wrappers around basic JavaScript operations.

Improvement Suggestions:
- Since functions are very simple, consider whether all are necessary or if some can be combined or optimized.
- For scalability, ensure consistent documentation and testing, especially if functions are extended.
- The comment about repeating dummy functions to reach ~200 lines suggests potential for code generation or automation, but this does not impact current complexity.

Overall, the code is very simple and maintainable with negligible complexity concerns.

## File: `./sample_js_files/calculator.js`

**Complexity Score:** 3/10

**Main Concerns:**
- The class is straightforward with minimal branching, primarily in the `compute` method.
- No nested loops or complex data structures.
- Branching is limited to simple if-else statements, which keep the complexity low.

**Improvement Suggestions:**
- Use a switch statement in `compute` for clearer branching if more operations are added.
- Add input validation to ensure `x` is a number.
- Consider extending the `compute` method to handle more operations dynamically, which could increase complexity but improve flexibility.

Overall, the code is simple and maintainable, with low complexity.
