## File: `./sample_js_files/complex.js`

**Complexity Score:** 6/10

**Main Concerns:**
- The `processData` function has nested loops and conditionals, leading to potentially high time complexity, especially with large array values.
- The `deepNest` function exhibits cubic time complexity (O(nÂ³)), which can be very slow for large `n`.
- The `lotsOfBranches` function has multiple branches, but overall low complexity; however, the branching adds some decision-making overhead.

**Improvement Suggestions:**
- Optimize `processData` by avoiding nested loops for odd numbers, perhaps using mathematical formulas to sum ranges.
- Consider reducing nesting in `deepNest` by refactoring or limiting `n`.
- Use switch-case or lookup tables for `lotsOfBranches` to improve clarity and possibly performance.
- Add comments or documentation to clarify intent and improve maintainability.

Overall, the code demonstrates moderate complexity mainly due to nested loops and branching, which could be optimized for better performance.

## File: `./sample_js_files/simple.js`

**Complexity Score:** 2/10

**Main Concerns:**  
- The code is straightforward, consisting of simple, atomic arithmetic functions.  
- No control flow, recursion, or nested structures increase complexity.  
- The only potential concern is the large number of functions, but they are individually trivial.

**Improvement Suggestions:**  
- Organize functions into categories or modules if the list grows further for better maintainability.  
- Consider adding input validation or error handling if used in critical contexts.  
- For code size, ensure consistent formatting and possibly generate repetitive functions programmatically to reduce manual effort.

Overall, the code is very simple with minimal complexity.

## File: `./sample_js_files/calculator.js`

**Complexity Score:** 3/10

**Main Concerns:**
- The class is straightforward with minimal branching.
- The `compute` method introduces some conditional branching, but it's simple and limited.
- No nested loops or complex data structures.

**Improvement Suggestions:**
- Consider using a switch statement in `compute` for better readability if more operations are added.
- Add input validation to ensure `x` is a number.
- Extend `compute` to handle more operations or support chaining for more advanced use cases.

Overall, the code is simple, maintainable, and has low complexity.
