## File: `./sample_js_files/complex.js`

**Complexity Assessment for complex.js**

**Overall Complexity Score: 6/10**

**Main Concerns:**
- The `deepNest` function exhibits cubic time complexity (O(nÂ³)), which can become a performance bottleneck with large `n`.
- The `processData` function contains nested loops, especially the inner loop for odd numbers, leading to potential quadratic or worse performance depending on input values.
- The `lotsOfBranches` function has minimal branching, so its complexity impact is negligible.

**Improvement Suggestions:**
- Optimize `deepNest` by reducing nested loops or employing mathematical formulas to compute sums directly.
- For `processData`, consider avoiding nested loops for large values or precomputing results where possible.
- Add input validation to prevent excessively large inputs that could degrade performance.
- Refactor branching logic in `lotsOfBranches` for clarity, though itâ€™s relatively simple.

**Summary:**
The code demonstrates nested loops and branching that can lead to high computational complexity

## File: `./sample_js_files/simple.js`

Complexity Score: 2/10

Main Concerns:
- The code consists of straightforward, single-operation functions with minimal logic.
- No control flow, recursion, or nested structures.
- The functions are simple wrappers around basic arithmetic operations.

Improvement Suggestions:
- Since functions are very simple, consider whether all are necessary or if some can be combined or omitted.
- For larger projects, adding input validation could improve robustness.
- Maintain consistent documentation for each function for clarity.

Overall, the code is very simple and maintainable with negligible complexity concerns.

## File: `./sample_js_files/calculator.js`

**Complexity Score:** 3/10

**Main Concerns:**
- The class is straightforward with minimal branching.
- The `compute` method introduces some branching logic, but it's simple and limited.
- No nested loops or deep recursion; overall control flow is linear.

**Improvement Suggestions:**
- Consider using a switch statement in `compute` for better readability.
- Add validation for input types to enhance robustness.
- Extend `compute` to handle more operations or support chaining for increased functionality, which could raise complexity.

Overall, the code is simple and well-structured, suitable for basic arithmetic operations with minimal complexity.
