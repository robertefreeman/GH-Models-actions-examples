## File: `./sample_js_files/calculator.js`

**Complexity Score:** 3/10

**Main concerns:**
- The class is straightforward with minimal branching.
- The `compute` method introduces some branching logic, but it’s simple and limited.
- No nested loops or recursive calls; the control flow is linear.

**Improvement suggestions:**
- Consider using a `switch` statement in `compute` for better readability if more operations are added.
- Add input validation to ensure `x` is a number.
- Extend `compute` to support more operations or handle invalid `op` values more gracefully.

Overall, the code is simple and maintainable with low complexity.

## File: `./sample_js_files/simple.js`

Complexity Score: 2/10

Main Concerns:
- The code consists solely of simple, stateless arithmetic functions with minimal logic.
- No control flow, recursion, or complex data structures are present.
- The functions are straightforward and easy to understand.

Improvement Suggestions:
- Since functions are very simple, consider grouping related functions or using more concise syntax (e.g., arrow functions).
- For scalability, ensure consistent documentation and testing as the codebase grows.
- The comment about repeating dummy functions to reach ~200 lines suggests potential for code duplication; consider generating such functions programmatically if needed.

Overall, the code is highly maintainable with negligible complexity concerns.

## File: `./sample_js_files/complex.js`

**Complexity Score:** 6/10

**Main Concerns:**
- The `processData` function has nested loops, especially the inner loop that sums up to `arr[i]`, which can be costly if `arr[i]` is large.
- The `deepNest` function exhibits cubic time complexity (O(n³)), which can become very slow with larger `n`.
- The `lotsOfBranches` function has multiple conditional branches, but overall complexity remains low; however, the branching adds some decision-making overhead.

**Improvement Suggestions:**
- Optimize nested loops in `deepNest` by reducing unnecessary iterations or using mathematical formulas to compute sums directly.
- For `processData`, consider alternative approaches to avoid nested loops for large values.
- Use early returns or switch statements in `lotsOfBranches` for clarity and potential minor performance gains.
- Overall, focus on reducing deep nesting and large iteration counts to improve performance and maintainability.
