## File: `./sample_js_files/calculator.js`

**Complexity Score:** 3/10

**Main Concerns:**
- The class is straightforward with minimal branching.
- The `compute` method introduces some conditional logic, but it's simple and limited.
- No nested loops or complex data structures are used.

**Improvement Suggestions:**
- Consider using a switch statement in `compute` for clarity.
- Add input validation for method arguments to enhance robustness.
- Extend `compute` to handle more operations or support chaining for better usability.

Overall, the code is simple and maintainable with low complexity.

## File: `./sample_js_files/complex.js`

**Complexity Score:** 6/10

**Main Concerns:**
- The `deepNest` function exhibits cubic time complexity (O(nÂ³)), which can become problematic with large `n`.
- The `processData` function has nested loops that depend on array values, potentially leading to high runtime for large or unbounded input.
- The `lotsOfBranches` function has multiple branches, but overall low complexity; however, branching adds some decision-making overhead.

**Improvement Suggestions:**
- Limit or optimize nested loops, especially in `deepNest`, possibly by reducing nesting depth or using mathematical formulas to compute results directly.
- For `processData`, consider more efficient algorithms if applicable, or impose constraints on input size.
- Use early returns or switch statements in `lotsOfBranches` for clarity and slight performance gains.
- Add comments or documentation to clarify intent, especially for complex nested logic.

Overall, the code demonstrates moderate complexity mainly due to nested loops and branching, which could

## File: `./sample_js_files/simple.js`

Complexity Score: 2/10

Main Concerns:
- The code consists of straightforward, single-operation functions with minimal logic.
- No control flow, recursion, or nested structures.
- The functions are simple wrappers around basic arithmetic operations.

Improvement Suggestions:
- Since functions are very simple, consider whether all are necessary or if some can be combined.
- Add input validation for robustness if used in critical contexts.
- For larger projects, modularize functions into separate files for better maintainability, especially if more functions are added.

Overall, the code is very simple and low in complexity, suitable for demonstration or utility purposes.
