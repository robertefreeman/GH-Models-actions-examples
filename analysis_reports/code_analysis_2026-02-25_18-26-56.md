## File: `./sample_js_files/calculator.js`

**Complexity Score:** 3/10

**Main Concerns:**
- The class is straightforward with minimal branching.
- The `compute` method introduces some branching, but it's limited to simple if-else statements.
- No nested loops or complex data structures are present.
- Error handling is minimal but appropriate for the scope.

**Improvement Suggestions:**
- Use a switch statement in `compute` for clearer branching.
- Extend `compute` to support more operations or handle invalid inputs more gracefully.
- Consider adding validation for input types to enhance robustness.
- For larger scale, modularize operations or use a command pattern to reduce branching.

Overall, the code is simple and maintainable, with low complexity.

## File: `./sample_js_files/simple.js`

Complexity Score: 2/10

Main concerns:
- The code consists solely of straightforward, single-purpose arithmetic functions.
- No control flow, loops, or nested structures.
- Minimal cognitive load; functions are simple and self-explanatory.

Improvement suggestions:
- Since functions are very simple, consider whether all are necessary or if some can be combined or omitted.
- For maintainability, add descriptive comments or documentation for each function.
- If the dummy functions are placeholders, ensure they are clearly marked or removed before production.

Overall, the code is very simple with negligible complexity.

## File: `./sample_js_files/complex.js`

**Complexity Score:** 6/10

**Main Concerns:**
- The `deepNest` function exhibits cubic time complexity (O(n³)), which can become costly with large `n`.
- The `processData` function has nested loops, especially the inner loop for odd numbers, leading to potential quadratic or worse performance depending on input.
- The `lotsOfBranches` function has multiple conditional branches, but overall minimal impact on complexity.

**Improvement Suggestions:**
- Optimize `deepNest` by reducing nested loops or using mathematical formulas to compute sums directly.
- For `processData`, consider alternative logic to avoid nested loops for large values, such as summation formulas.
- Limit input sizes or add input validation to prevent performance issues.
- Refactor `lotsOfBranches` to use a switch statement or lookup table for clarity if branches grow.

Overall, the code demonstrates moderate complexity mainly due to nested loops and branching, which could be optimized for better performance.
