## File: `./sample_js_files/complex.js`

**Complexity Score:** 6/10

**Main Concerns:**
- The `processData` function has nested loops and conditionals, leading to potential quadratic or worse complexity depending on input values.
- The `deepNest` function introduces cubic time complexity with triple nested loops, which can become very slow for large `n`.
- The `lotsOfBranches` function has multiple conditional branches, but overall linear in input size.

**Improvement Suggestions:**
- Optimize nested loops in `deepNest` by reducing unnecessary iterations or using mathematical formulas to compute results directly.
- In `processData`, consider more efficient data processing techniques if applicable, such as avoiding inner loops for large numbers.
- For `lotsOfBranches`, consider using a switch-case or lookup table for cleaner branch handling if the number of branches grows.
- Add comments or documentation to clarify intent, especially for complex nested logic, to improve maintainability.

Overall, the code demonstrates moderate complexity primarily due to nested loops and branching

## File: `./sample_js_files/simple.js`

Complexity Score: 2/10

Main Concerns:
- The code consists of straightforward, single-purpose arithmetic functions with minimal logic.
- No control flow, recursion, or complex data structures are present.
- The functions are simple wrappers around basic arithmetic operations.

Improvement Suggestions:
- Given the simplicity, consider grouping related functions or creating a utility class if expansion is needed.
- Add input validation if used in critical applications.
- Maintain consistent documentation for clarity, especially for edge cases (e.g., division by zero).

Overall, the code is very simple and maintainable, with negligible complexity concerns.

## File: `./sample_js_files/calculator.js`

**Complexity Score:** 3/10

**Main concerns:**
- The class is straightforward with minimal branching.
- The `compute` method introduces some conditional logic, but it's simple and limited.
- No nested loops or deep recursion; branching is limited to a few `if-else` statements.
- Error handling is minimal but appropriate for the scope.

**Improvement suggestions:**
- Use a `switch` statement in `compute` for better readability if more operations are added.
- Extend `compute` to handle more operations or invalid inputs gracefully.
- Consider adding input validation for method parameters for robustness.

Overall, the code is simple, well-structured, and low in complexity.
