## File: `./sample_js_files/calculator.js`

**Complexity Score:** 3/10

**Main Concerns:**
- The class is straightforward with minimal branching.
- The `compute` method introduces some conditional branching, but it's limited to two branches.
- No nested loops or recursive calls.
- Error handling is simple and localized.

**Improvement Suggestions:**
- Extend `compute` to handle more operations (e.g., multiply, divide) for flexibility, which would slightly increase complexity.
- Consider using a switch statement for better readability in `compute`.
- Add input validation for method parameters to improve robustness.
- For more advanced use, implement operation dispatch via a map/object to reduce branching.

Overall, the code is simple and well-structured, with low complexity.

## File: `./sample_js_files/simple.js`

Complexity Score: 2/10

Main Concerns:
- The code consists of straightforward, single-purpose arithmetic functions with minimal logic.
- No control flow, nested structures, or complex algorithms present.
- The only potential concern is the repetitive nature, but it doesn't impact complexity significantly.

Improvement Suggestions:
- Consider grouping related functions into modules (e.g., basic operations, array operations) for better organization.
- Add input validation if used in broader contexts.
- Since the code is simple, no major refactoring is necessary.

Overall, the code is very simple and maintainable.

## File: `./sample_js_files/complex.js`

**Complexity Score:** 6/10

**Main Concerns:**
- The `processData` function has nested loops, especially the inner loop that sums up to `arr[i]`, which can lead to quadratic or worse complexity depending on input.
- The `deepNest` function's triple nested loops result in O(n³) complexity, which can become very costly for large `n`.
- The `lotsOfBranches` function has multiple conditional branches, but overall complexity remains low; however, branching can complicate testing and reasoning.

**Improvement Suggestions:**
- Optimize nested loops: for `processData`, consider using mathematical formulas to avoid inner loops when possible.
- Limit nesting depth or refactor deeply nested functions to reduce cognitive and computational complexity.
- Use early returns or switch statements in `lotsOfBranches` for clearer branching logic.
- Add input validation to prevent excessively large inputs that could cause performance issues.

Overall, the code demonstrates moderate complexity mainly due to nested loops and
