**Complexity Assessment of complex.js**

**Overall Complexity Score:** 6/10

**Main Concerns:**
- The `deepNest` function exhibits cubic time complexity (O(nÂ³)), which can become a performance bottleneck with large `n`.
- The `processData` function contains nested loops, especially the inner loop for odd numbers, leading to potentially high execution time depending on input values.
- The `lotsOfBranches` function has minimal branching; however, the multiple conditional branches could be streamlined.

**Improvement Suggestions:**
- Optimize `deepNest` by reducing nested loops or limiting `n` to manageable sizes.
- For `processData`, consider alternative algorithms that avoid nested loops for large odd numbers, such as mathematical formulas to sum ranges.
- Simplify `lotsOfBranches` using a switch-case or a lookup table for better readability and maintainability.
- Overall, consider refactoring to reduce nested complexity and improve scalability.

**Summary:** The code demonstrates nested loops

## File: `./sample_js_files/simple.js`

**Complexity Score:** 2/10

**Main Concerns:**  
- The code consists of straightforward, single-purpose arithmetic functions with minimal control flow or nested logic.  
- No significant performance issues or complexity concerns.  
- The only potential concern is the large number of similar functions, which could be refactored for maintainability.

**Improvement Suggestions:**  
- Consider grouping related functions into utility classes or objects (e.g., `Arithmetic`) to improve organization.  
- Use higher-order functions or parameterized functions to reduce redundancy (e.g., a generic `operate` function).  
- Add input validation if functions are exposed publicly to prevent unexpected errors.  

Overall, the code is simple, clear, and maintainable as is, with minor opportunities for refactoring.

## File: `./sample_js_files/calculator.js`

**Complexity Score:** 3/10

**Main Concerns:**
- The class is straightforward with minimal branching.
- The `compute` method introduces some conditional logic, but it's simple and limited.
- No nested loops or recursion, keeping complexity low.

**Improvement Suggestions:**
- Consider using a switch statement in `compute` for better readability if more operations are added.
- Add input validation to ensure `x` is a number.
- Extend `compute` to handle more operations or support chaining for more advanced use cases.

Overall, the code is simple and easy to maintain, with low complexity.
