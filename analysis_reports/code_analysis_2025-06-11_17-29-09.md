## File: `./sample_js_files/complex.js`

**Complexity Score:** 6/10

**Main Concerns:**
- The `deepNest` function exhibits cubic time complexity (O(nÂ³)), which can become a performance bottleneck with large `n`.
- The `processData` function has nested loops that depend on array values, leading to potentially high complexity if array elements are large.
- The `lotsOfBranches` function has multiple conditional branches, but overall low complexity.

**Improvement Suggestions:**
- Optimize `deepNest` by reducing nested loops or limiting `n`.
- For `processData`, consider more efficient algorithms if large numbers are expected, e.g., avoiding nested loops for large values.
- Use switch-case or lookup tables in `lotsOfBranches` for cleaner branching if the number of branches grows.
- Add input validation to prevent unexpected large inputs that could cause performance issues.

Overall, the code demonstrates moderate complexity mainly due to nested loops and branching, with room for optimization in performance-critical parts.

## File: `./sample_js_files/simple.js`

Complexity Score: 2/10

Main Concerns:
- The code consists of straightforward, single-operation functions with minimal logic.
- No control flow, recursion, or nested structures present.
- The functions are simple wrappers around basic arithmetic operations.

Improvement Suggestions:
- Since functions are trivial, consider whether all are necessary or if some can be combined or omitted.
- Add input validation if used in critical applications.
- For larger codebases, modularize functions into separate files for better maintainability, especially if more complex logic is added later.

Overall, the code is very simple with negligible complexity.

## File: `./sample_js_files/calculator.js`

**Complexity Score:** 3/10

**Main Concerns:**
- The class is straightforward with minimal branching.
- The `compute` method introduces some conditional logic, but it's simple and limited.
- No nested loops or complex data structures.

**Improvement Suggestions:**
- Consider using a `switch` statement in `compute` for clarity.
- Add input validation to ensure `x` is a number.
- Extend `compute` to handle more operations or use a strategy pattern for scalability.
- Document edge cases, such as division by zero, more explicitly.

Overall, the code is simple and maintainable, with low complexity.
