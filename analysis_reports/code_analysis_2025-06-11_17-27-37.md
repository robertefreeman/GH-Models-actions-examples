## File: `./sample_js_files/complex.js`

**Complexity Score:** 6/10

**Main Concerns:**
- The `deepNest` function exhibits cubic time complexity (O(nÂ³)), which can become costly with large `n`.
- The `processData` function contains nested loops that, in the worst case, can lead to quadratic behavior if array elements are large.
- The `lotsOfBranches` function has multiple conditional branches, but overall low complexity.

**Improvement Suggestions:**
- Optimize `deepNest` by reducing nested loops or employing mathematical formulas to compute results directly.
- For `processData`, consider avoiding nested loops for large numbers, perhaps by precomputing or using formulas.
- Simplify `lotsOfBranches` if possible, or replace multiple `if-else` with a lookup table or switch statement for clarity.
- Overall, refactor to reduce nested loops and branching where feasible to improve performance and maintainability.

## File: `./sample_js_files/simple.js`

Complexity Score: 2/10

Main Concerns:
- The code consists of straightforward, single-purpose functions with minimal logic.
- No control flow complexity or nested structures.
- The only potential concern is the repetitive nature, but that doesn't impact complexity significantly.

Improvement Suggestions:
- Maintainability could be improved by grouping similar functions or using higher-order functions if needed.
- Consider adding input validation or error handling for robustness, especially for functions like divide and array operations.
- Since the functions are simple, the current design is appropriate; focus on documentation and testing instead.

Overall, the code is very simple with negligible complexity.

## File: `./sample_js_files/calculator.js`

**Complexity Score:** 3/10

**Main Concerns:**
- The class is straightforward with minimal branching.
- The `compute` method introduces some branching logic, but it's simple and limited.
- No nested loops or complex data structures.

**Improvement Suggestions:**
- Consider using a `switch` statement in `compute` for clarity.
- Add input validation for method parameters.
- Expand `compute` to handle more operations or accept functions for extensibility.
- Document edge cases, such as division by zero, more explicitly.

Overall, the code is simple, with low complexity and clear structure.
