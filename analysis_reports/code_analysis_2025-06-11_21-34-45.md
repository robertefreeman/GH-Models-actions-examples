**Complexity Assessment for complex.js**

**Overall Complexity Score: 6/10**

**Main Concerns:**
- **Nested loops in `deepNest`**: The triple nested loops result in O(nÂ³) complexity, which can be costly for large `n`.
- **Nested logic in `processData`**: The inner loop for odd numbers can lead to quadratic behavior depending on input values.
- **Branching in `lotsOfBranches`**: Multiple conditional branches, though simple, can add to decision complexity, especially if extended.

**Improvement Suggestions:**
- Optimize `deepNest` by reducing nesting or limiting `n`.
- For `processData`, consider alternative algorithms that avoid nested loops for large datasets.
- Use switch-case or lookup tables in `lotsOfBranches` for cleaner branch management if expanded.
- Add input validation to prevent excessively large inputs that could cause performance issues.

**Summary:** The code demonstrates moderate complexity mainly due to nested loops and branching.

## File: `./sample_js_files/simple.js`

Complexity Score: 2/10

Main Concerns:
- The code consists of straightforward, single-purpose arithmetic functions with minimal logic.
- No control flow, recursion, or complex data structures are involved.
- The functions are simple and easy to understand, with no nested or conditional logic.

Improvement Suggestions:
- Since functions are very simple, consider whether all are necessary or if some can be combined or optimized.
- For scalability, ensure consistent documentation and possibly add input validation if used in broader contexts.
- The comment about repeating dummy functions to reach ~200 lines suggests potential for code generation or automation, but this does not impact complexity significantly.

Overall, the code is very simple and maintainable with negligible complexity concerns.

## File: `./sample_js_files/calculator.js`

**Complexity Score:** 3/10

**Main concerns:**
- The class is straightforward with simple methods; minimal branching.
- The `compute` method introduces some branching, but it's limited to a few conditions.
- No nested loops or complex control structures.

**Improvement suggestions:**
- Use a switch statement in `compute` for clarity and scalability.
- Add input validation for method parameters.
- Consider extending `compute` to handle more operations or using a map for operation dispatching to reduce branching.

Overall, the code is simple and maintainable with low complexity.
