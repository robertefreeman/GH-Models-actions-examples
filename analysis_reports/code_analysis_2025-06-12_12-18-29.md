## File: `./sample_js_files/complex.js`

Complexity Score: 6/10

Main Concerns:
- The `deepNest` function exhibits cubic time complexity (O(nÂ³)), which can become a performance bottleneck with large `n`.
- The `processData` function contains nested loops that can lead to quadratic or worse complexity depending on input values, especially with large odd numbers.
- The `lotsOfBranches` function has minimal branching, so its complexity impact is low.

Improvement Suggestions:
- Optimize nested loops in `deepNest` by reducing nesting or limiting input size.
- For `processData`, consider more efficient algorithms if applicable, such as avoiding inner loops over large numbers.
- Use early returns or switch statements in `lotsOfBranches` for clarity, though impact on complexity is minimal.
- Overall, focus on reducing nested loops and avoiding large iterations where possible to improve performance.

## File: `./sample_js_files/simple.js`

**Complexity Score:** 2/10

**Main Concerns:**  
- The code consists solely of straightforward, single-purpose arithmetic functions with no control flow, nested logic, or complex data structures.  
- The functions are simple and easy to understand, with minimal cognitive load.

**Improvement Suggestions:**  
- Since all functions are basic, consider grouping related functions into categories or modules for better organization if the codebase grows.  
- Add input validation if used in critical contexts, though it's not necessary for demonstration purposes.  
- The comment about repeating dummy functions to reach ~200 lines suggests potential for code generation or automation to avoid manual repetition.

**Overall:**  
The code is very simple with minimal complexity. It is well-suited for its demonstration purpose, and no significant improvements are necessary unless functionality expands.

## File: `./sample_js_files/calculator.js`

**Complexity Score:** 3/10

**Main Concerns:**
- The class is straightforward with minimal branching.
- The `compute` method introduces some conditional logic, but it's simple and limited.
- No nested loops or deep recursion; the code is primarily linear.

**Improvement Suggestions:**
- Use a `switch` statement in `compute` for better readability and scalability if more operations are added.
- Add validation for input types to prevent runtime errors.
- Consider extending `compute` to handle more operations dynamically via a mapping object, reducing branching.

Overall, the code is simple and maintainable with low complexity.
