## File: `./sample_js_files/complex.js`

**Complexity Score:** 6/10

**Main Concerns:**
- The `deepNest` function exhibits cubic time complexity (O(nÂ³)), which can become a performance bottleneck with large `n`.
- The `processData` function contains nested loops, especially the inner loop that sums up to `arr[i]`, leading to potential quadratic or worse complexity depending on input.
- The `lotsOfBranches` function has multiple conditional branches, but overall minimal impact unless heavily used with large inputs.

**Improvement Suggestions:**
- Optimize `deepNest` by reducing nested loops or limiting `n`.
- For `processData`, consider alternative algorithms to avoid nested loops, such as mathematical formulas for summations.
- Simplify or consolidate branches in `lotsOfBranches` if possible, or replace with a lookup table for large-scale use.
- Add input validation and consider early exits to improve efficiency.

Overall, the code demonstrates moderate complexity mainly due to nested loops and branching, but

## File: `./sample_js_files/simple.js`

Complexity Score: 2/10

Main Concerns:  
- The code consists of straightforward, single-purpose arithmetic functions with minimal control flow.  
- No nested functions, recursion, or complex logic present.  
- The only potential concern is the repetitive pattern, but it doesn't impact execution complexity.

Improvement Suggestions:  
- Since functions are simple, consider consolidating similar operations (e.g., `double`, `triple`, `square`, `cube`) into a more flexible function with parameters to reduce redundancy.  
- Add input validation if necessary, especially for functions like `divide` to handle division by zero more explicitly.  
- Maintain documentation for each function for clarity, especially if the codebase grows.

Overall, the code is very simple with negligible complexity concerns.

## File: `./sample_js_files/calculator.js`

**Complexity Score:** 3/10

**Main concerns:**
- The class is straightforward with minimal branching.
- The `compute` method introduces some branching, but it's limited to simple conditionals.
- No nested loops or recursion.
- The code is easy to follow and maintain.

**Improvement suggestions:**
- Use a `switch` statement in `compute` for better readability if more operations are added.
- Consider adding input validation for method parameters.
- Extend `compute` to support more operations or use a map/dictionary for operation dispatching to improve scalability.

Overall, the code is simple with low complexity, suitable for demonstration purposes.
