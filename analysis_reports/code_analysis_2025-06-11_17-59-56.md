## File: `./sample_js_files/complex.js`

**Complexity Score:** 6/10

**Main Concerns:**
- The `deepNest` function exhibits cubic time complexity (O(nÂ³)), which can be costly for large `n`.
- The `processData` function has nested loops with potential quadratic behavior depending on input values, especially with larger odd numbers.
- The `lotsOfBranches` function has multiple conditional branches, but overall minimal complexity impact.

**Improvement Suggestions:**
- Optimize nested loops in `deepNest` by reducing unnecessary iterations or using mathematical formulas to compute results directly.
- For `processData`, consider avoiding nested loops for large values or precomputing results when possible.
- Simplify branching logic in `lotsOfBranches` if applicable, or replace with lookup tables for better readability and performance.
- Overall, refactor deeply nested logic to reduce complexity and improve maintainability.

## File: `./sample_js_files/simple.js`

Complexity Score: 2/10

Main Concerns:
- The code consists of straightforward, atomic arithmetic functions with minimal logic.
- No control flow, nested structures, or complex algorithms are present.
- The functions are simple wrappers around basic JavaScript operations.

Improvement Suggestions:
- Since functions are very simple, consider whether all are necessary or if some can be combined or generalized.
- For scalability, ensure consistent documentation and possibly add input validation if used in broader contexts.
- The comment about repeating dummy functions suggests potential for code generation or automation, but as-is, it doesn't impact complexity significantly.

Overall, the code is very simple and maintainable with negligible complexity concerns.

## File: `./sample_js_files/calculator.js`

**Complexity Score:** 3/10

**Main concerns:**
- The class is straightforward with minimal branching.
- The `compute` method introduces some branching, but it's limited to two conditions.
- No nested loops or recursive calls.
- Error handling is simple and localized.

**Improvement suggestions:**
- Use a `switch` statement in `compute` for better scalability if more operations are added.
- Consider adding input validation for method parameters.
- For future complexity, implement a command pattern or operation map to reduce branching.

Overall, the code is simple and maintainable with low complexity.
