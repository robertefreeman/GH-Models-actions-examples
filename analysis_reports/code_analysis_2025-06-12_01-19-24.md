**Complexity Assessment for complex.js**

**Overall Complexity Score:** **6/10**

**Main Concerns:**
- The `deepNest` function exhibits cubic time complexity (O(nÂ³)), which can become costly with larger `n`.
- The `processData` function has nested loops where inner loop runs up to `arr[i]`, potentially leading to quadratic or worse performance depending on input data.
- The `lotsOfBranches` function has minimal branching; however, its linear branch checks are straightforward.

**Improvement Suggestions:**
- Optimize `deepNest` by reducing nesting or using mathematical formulas to compute sums directly.
- For `processData`, consider pre-processing or alternative algorithms if input arrays are large or performance-critical.
- Maintain simple branching in `lotsOfBranches`, but ensure input validation to prevent unexpected behavior.

**Summary:** The code demonstrates nested loops and branching that can lead to high computational costs, especially with large inputs. Simplifying nested logic and avoiding unnecessary loops can improve

## File: `./sample_js_files/simple.js`

Complexity Score: 2/10

Main Concerns:
- The code consists of straightforward, single-purpose arithmetic functions with minimal logic.
- No control flow, recursion, or complex data structures are present.
- The functions are simple and easy to understand, with predictable behavior.

Improvement Suggestions:
- Since functions are very simple, consider whether all need to be exported individually or if grouping related functions could improve organization.
- Add input validation if used in critical contexts to prevent unexpected errors.
- For larger codebases, consider modularizing functions into separate files for maintainability, especially if dummy functions are repeated to reach 200 lines.

Overall, the code is very simple with negligible complexity concerns.

## File: `./sample_js_files/calculator.js`

**Complexity Score:** 3/10

**Main Concerns:**
- The class is straightforward with minimal branching.
- The `compute` method introduces some branching logic, but it's simple and limited.
- No nested loops or recursive calls.
- Error handling is minimal but appropriate for the context.

**Improvement Suggestions:**
- Use a `switch` statement in `compute` for better readability if more operations are added.
- Extend error handling for invalid inputs.
- Consider adding validation for `x` to prevent unexpected errors.
- For scalability, implement a map of operations to functions to reduce branching.

Overall, the code is simple and maintainable with low complexity.
