## File: `./sample_js_files/complex.js`

**Complexity Score:** 6/10

**Main Concerns:**
- The `processData` function has nested loops and conditionals, leading to potentially high time complexity, especially with large input arrays.
- The `deepNest` function exhibits cubic time complexity (O(nÂ³)), which can become very slow as `n` increases.
- The `lotsOfBranches` function has multiple conditional branches, but overall low complexity; however, the branching adds some control flow complexity.

**Improvement Suggestions:**
- Optimize nested loops: consider mathematical formulas or early exits to reduce iteration counts.
- Limit the depth or size of input parameters for `deepNest` to prevent performance issues.
- Use switch-case or lookup tables for multiple branches instead of chained if-else for clarity and potential performance gains.
- Add comments or documentation to clarify intent, especially for complex nested logic.

Overall, the code demonstrates moderate complexity primarily due to nested loops and branching, which could be optimized for better performance and

## File: `./sample_js_files/simple.js`

Complexity Score: 2/10

Main Concerns:
- The code consists of straightforward, single-purpose arithmetic functions with minimal logic.
- No control flow, recursion, or nested structures present.
- The only potential concern is the repetitive nature, but it doesn't increase complexity significantly.

Improvement Suggestions:
- Since functions are simple, consider grouping related functions or using higher-order functions if needed.
- Ensure proper handling of edge cases (e.g., division by zero) where applicable.
- For maintainability, document functions with comments or use TypeScript for type safety if scaling.

Overall, the code is very simple and maintainable with negligible complexity.

## File: `./sample_js_files/calculator.js`

**Complexity Score:** 3/10

**Main Concerns:**
- The class is straightforward with minimal branchingâ€”only in the `divide` and `compute` methods.
- Branching is limited to simple if-else statements, which keeps complexity low.
- No nested loops or recursive calls.

**Improvement Suggestions:**
- Use a `switch` statement in `compute` for better readability if more operations are added.
- Implement input validation for method parameters to enhance robustness.
- Consider extending `compute` to handle more operations dynamically (e.g., via a map of functions), which could increase flexibility without significantly raising complexity.

Overall, the code is simple and well-structured, with low complexity and clear logic.
