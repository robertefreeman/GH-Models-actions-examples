## File: `./sample_js_files/complex.js`

**Complexity Score:** 6/10

**Main Concerns:**
- The `processData` function has nested loops and conditionals that can lead to high computational cost, especially with large input arrays.
- The `deepNest` function exhibits cubic time complexity (O(nÂ³)), which can become very slow as `n` increases.
- The `lotsOfBranches` function has multiple conditional branches, but overall complexity remains low; however, excessive branching can affect readability and maintainability.

**Improvement Suggestions:**
- Optimize `processData` by reducing nested loops, possibly by using more efficient algorithms or data structures.
- For `deepNest`, consider iterative approaches or memoization if applicable to reduce runtime.
- Simplify or refactor `lotsOfBranches` to improve clarity, perhaps using a switch statement or lookup table.
- Add comments or documentation to clarify intent, especially for complex nested logic.
- Consider input validation to prevent potential performance issues with unexpected data sizes.

## File: `./sample_js_files/simple.js`

Complexity Score: 2/10

Main Concerns:
- The code consists of straightforward, single-purpose arithmetic functions with minimal logic.
- No control flow, recursion, or nested structures.
- The only potential concern is the repetitive nature, but it doesn't impact complexity significantly.

Improvement Suggestions:
- Consider grouping similar functions (e.g., all array operations) into separate modules for better organization.
- Add input validation if used in broader contexts.
- For the dummy functions, ensure they are meaningful or remove if unnecessary.

Overall, the code is very simple and maintainable with negligible complexity.

## File: `./sample_js_files/calculator.js`

**Complexity Score:** 3/10

**Main Concerns:**
- The class is straightforward with minimal branching.
- The `compute` method introduces some branching, but it's simple and limited.
- No nested loops or deep recursion, keeping complexity low.

**Improvement Suggestions:**
- Consider using a `switch` statement in `compute` for better readability if more operations are added.
- Add input validation for method arguments to enhance robustness.
- Extend `compute` to support more operations or handle invalid inputs gracefully.

Overall, the code is simple and maintainable with low complexity.
