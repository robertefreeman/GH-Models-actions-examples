## File: `./sample_js_files/complex.js`

Complexity Score: 6/10

Main Concerns:
- Nested loops in `deepNest` lead to O(n^3) time complexity, which can be costly for large `n`.
- The `processData` function has nested loops, especially the inner loop for odd numbers, resulting in potentially high complexity depending on input values.
- The `lotsOfBranches` function has multiple conditional branches, but overall low complexity; however, multiple branches can complicate testing and maintenance.

Improvement Suggestions:
- Optimize `processData` by avoiding nested loops for odd numbers, perhaps by summing arithmetic series directly.
- Limit or parameterize the depth of nested loops in `deepNest` to prevent excessive runtime.
- Use switch statements or lookup tables in `lotsOfBranches` for cleaner branch handling if more branches are added.
- Consider adding input validation to prevent excessively large inputs that could cause performance issues.

Overall, the code demonstrates nested complexity that can be optimized for better performance and maintainability

## File: `./sample_js_files/simple.js`

Complexity Score: 2/10

Main Concerns:
- The code consists of straightforward, single-operation functions with minimal logic.
- No control flow statements, loops, or nested structures.
- The functions are simple wrappers around basic arithmetic operations.

Improvement Suggestions:
- Since functions are simple, consider whether all are necessary or if some can be combined or omitted.
- For maintainability, add input validation if used in critical contexts.
- The comment about repeating dummy functions suggests potential for code generation or automation, but as-is, it doesn't impact complexity.

Overall, the code is very simple and low in complexity, suitable for demonstration or utility purposes.

## File: `./sample_js_files/calculator.js`

**Complexity Score:** 3/10

**Main Concerns:**
- The class is straightforward with minimal branching; only `compute()` has conditional logic.
- No nested loops or deep recursion.
- Methods are simple and directly map to basic arithmetic operations.

**Improvement Suggestions:**
- Expand `compute()` to handle more operations (e.g., multiply, divide) for flexibility.
- Add input validation to ensure `x` is a number.
- Consider using a switch statement in `compute()` for clarity.
- Document edge cases, such as division by zero, more explicitly.

Overall, the code is simple and maintainable, with low complexity.
