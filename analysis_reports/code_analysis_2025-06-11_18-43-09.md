## File: `./sample_js_files/complex.js`

**Complexity Score:** 6/10

**Main Concerns:**
- The `deepNest` function exhibits cubic time complexity (O(nÂ³)), which can become costly with larger `n`.
- The `processData` function has nested loops, especially the inner loop for odd numbers, leading to potentially high runtime depending on input values.
- The `lotsOfBranches` function has multiple conditional branches, but overall low complexity.

**Improvement Suggestions:**
- Optimize nested loops in `deepNest` by reducing unnecessary iterations or using mathematical formulas to compute results directly.
- For `processData`, consider alternative algorithms that avoid nested loops for large values, such as summation formulas.
- Limit the depth of nesting and branching where possible, and add comments to clarify the intent and complexity implications.
- Implement input validation to prevent excessively large inputs that could cause performance issues.

## File: `./sample_js_files/simple.js`

Complexity Score: 2/10

Main Concerns:
- The code consists of straightforward, single-purpose arithmetic functions with minimal control flow.
- No nested functions, loops, or conditionals beyond simple checks (e.g., division by zero).
- Overall, very low complexity and easy to understand.

Improvement Suggestions:
- Since functions are simple, consider inlining or combining related operations if appropriate.
- For scalability, ensure consistent documentation and testing.
- The comment about repeating dummy functions to reach ~200 lines suggests potential for code bloat; consider generating such functions programmatically or using more concise patterns to reduce manual repetition.

Overall, the code is highly maintainable with negligible complexity concerns.

## File: `./sample_js_files/calculator.js`

**Complexity Score:** 3/10

**Main concerns:**
- The class is straightforward with minimal branching.
- The `compute` method has simple conditional logic, but could be expanded for more operations.
- No nested loops or complex control flow.

**Improvement suggestions:**
- Use a switch statement in `compute` for better readability if more operations are added.
- Consider input validation for method parameters to enhance robustness.
- For scalability, implement a dispatch table (object mapping operation strings to functions) instead of multiple if-else branches.

Overall, the code is simple with low complexity, suitable for basic arithmetic operations.
