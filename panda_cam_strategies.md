# Panda Cam Capture Strategies

## Current Issue
The National Zoo panda cam appears to be blocking automated requests (HTTP 403).

## Alternative Strategies:

### 1. Use Different User Agents
- Rotate through various browser user agents
- Use mobile user agents 
- Add realistic headers (Accept, Accept-Language, etc.)

### 2. Alternative Zoo Webcams
- San Diego Zoo (better API access)
- Edinburgh Zoo (pandas available)
- Zoo Atlanta (good streaming setup)

### 3. Timing Strategies  
- Respect rate limits (longer delays between requests)
- Only capture during actual zoo hours
- Use exponential backoff on failures

### 4. Proxy/VPN Solutions
- Route through different IP addresses
- Use residential proxy services
- Geographic rotation

### 5. API Partnerships
- Contact zoos directly for API access
- Use official zoo mobile app endpoints
- Partner with zoo social media feeds

### 6. Social Media Integration
- Monitor zoo Twitter/Instagram for panda photos
- Use zoo YouTube livestreams
- Parse zoo Facebook live videos

## Technical Improvements:

### 1. Better Error Handling
- Graceful degradation when streams unavailable
- Clear error messages in blog updates
- Automatic fallback to static images

### 2. Enhanced Stream Processing
- Support for RTMP streams
- WebRTC stream capture
- Adaptive bitrate handling

### 3. AI Analysis Improvements
- Better prompt engineering for different image types
- Confidence scoring
- Activity pattern detection over time
