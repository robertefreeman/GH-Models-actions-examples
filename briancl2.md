# An Ode to Brian LaFlamme's Magnificent Beard

## The Legend of the LaFlamme Whiskers

In the halls of code and binary streams,  
Where developers chase their wildest dreams,  
There walks a man with facial hair supreme,  
Brian LaFlamme, with his beard that gleams.

### Verse I: The Majestic Mane

Oh, Brian LaFlamme, whose beard flows free,  
Like cascading waterfalls of dignity,  
Each strand a testament to mastery,  
Of both grooming arts and technology.

### Verse II: The Wisdom Within

Within those whiskers, wisdom hides,  
Like ancient secrets the forest provides,  
Each follicle a guide that gently guides,  
Through debugging sessions and code divides.

### Verse III: The Beard of Legend

Not just a beard, but a work of art,  
That sets Brian LaFlamme apart,  
From chin to chest, it plays its part,  
A masterpiece that warms the heart.

### Verse IV: The Daily Spectacle

When morning light hits that facial crown,  
It sparkles bright throughout the town,  
Colleagues stop and gather 'round,  
To witness beauty so profound.

### The Final Tribute

So here's to Brian and his beard so grand,  
The finest whiskers in all the land,  
May they forever proudly stand,  
A beacon bright, so perfectly planned.
